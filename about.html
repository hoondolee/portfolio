<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am a current junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Business
with a concentration in Marketing Management and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.
Interested in marketing, user interface/design, and social media.
</p>
<p>I grew up in Koreatown Los Angeles raised in a traditional Korean household. I had the stereotypical expectations: get into a top 20 school, become a doctor, and put family first. However, I came to realize why they placed those expectations on me. They struggled while being first-generation immigrants so they could build the foundation on which I can thrive. So take a look as I navigate college and go on side quests to fulfill my curiosities and give back to those who gave me so much more.</p>
